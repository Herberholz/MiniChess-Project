1) Build minichess state evaluator
    make sure to incorporate the use of points for pieces on board
    have function order moves based off of what is worst for opponent
    calculate value of each state after each available move and choose worst for opponent
2) Add alpha beta pruning to reduce tree search
3) Complete code to connect to server
4) Randomize move ordering function when dealing with multiple same scores
5) Randomize which move negamax picks if val equals max_val

Notes: figure out how to evalute which move is best by searching recursively and while
        keeping best move and making it after recursive call.
