1) Update minichess state evaluator
2) Randomize move ordering function when dealing with multiple same scores
3) Randomize which move negamax picks if val equals max_val

Notes: figure out how to evalute which move is best by searching recursively and while
        keeping best move and making it after recursive call.

        When every move leads to a loss then first element will be chosen. Make 
        sure that it is not a king sacrifice to go for draw.

Issue: When adding -O3 to Makefile to optimize code, it makes some lines of code
        get repeated which can cause issues. Happened when i added extra variable
        to Board class. I got a buffer overflow from calling sprintf twice.
